UPDATE: Black Butte Lake is undergoing a lake-wide cyanobacteria bloom. On May 30, 2019 state officials sampled 4 sites in Black Butte Lake (Buckhorn Day Use Area, Orland Buttes Boat Ramp area, Eagle Pass Recreation Area, and the bowl near the dam/observation point).

Recreational users are urged to use caution when recreating at the lake and to practice healthy habits (follow posted signs, rinse off with freshwater after swimming in lake, keep pets out of water and do not let them drink the lake water).   Borrow ponds also have cyanobacteria present but no toxins detected.  Park management has posted USACE algae watch signs at the lake. For more information on site conditions, contact the Black Butte Lake USACE Park Ranger Office at (530) 865-4781.

2020 HAB Weekly Monitoring Results
7/02/20:  On 6/30/20, Microcystis-type cyanobacteria colonies 6 inches apart were suspended along the rip rap between the kayak launch and fishing dock. We did not test as conditions were similar to last week.

On 6/23/20, Microcystis-type cyanobacteria colonies were observed at the kayak launch. A sample was tested for Microcystins, using the Abraxis CAAS ELISA, resulting in greater than 50 ppb.

On 6/17/20, up to pinhead sized Microcystis-type cyanobacteria colonies were observed along the shore at the fishing dock. A sample was tested for Microcystins, using the Abraxis strip test kit, resulting in more than 10 ppb.

7/02/20:  On 7/1/20, a few small cyanobacteria colonies were observed around the boat launch. Under the microscope, Microcystis-type cyanobacteria were identified. A sample from the boat launch was tested for Microcystins, using the Abraxis strip test kit, resulting in 5 ppb. On 7/2/20, small specs of Dolichospermum-type and Microcystis-type cyanobacteria were observed around the boat launch. Water samples were collected from the drinking water raw intake, from post-clarifier and from finished drinking water. All samples were tested for Microcystins, using the Abraxis strip test kits, resulting in non-detects for all tests.

On 6/23/20, a few small Dolichospermum-type cyanobacteria colonies were observed around the boat launch. A sample from the boat launch was tested for Microcystins, using the Abraxis CAAS ELISA, resulting in a non-detect.

On 6/18/20, staff sampled the finished drinking water using Abraxis strip testing (Cylindrospermopsin and Anatoxin- A) and results were non-detect for both toxins. Bend Genetics identified Cylindrospermum and Pseudoanabaena in the clarifier and Dolichospermum at the boat launch. We are still waiting for Bend Genetics toxin results for the boat launch, clarifier and finished water.

On 6/16/20, a few small Dolichospermum-type cyanobacteria colonies were observed around the boat launch. A sample from the boat launch was tested for Microcystins, using the Abraxis strip test kit, resulting in a non-detect. Per our HABs Drinking Water protocol, samples from the raw water and finished water were sent to Bend Genetics laboratory for confirmation testing on 6/17/20. 

On 6/11/20, a few small Dolichospermum-type and Aphanizomenon-type cyanobacteria colonies were observed around the boat launch. A sample from the drinking water intake was tested for Microcystins, using the Abraxis strip test kit, resulting in a non-detect. 

On 6/4/20, few small colonies of Dolichospermum-type cyanobacteria were observed around the boat launch. A sample was analyzed for Cylindrospermopsin, using the Abraxis strip test kit, resulting in a non-detect.

On 5/28/20, few small colonies of Dolichospermum-type cyanobacteria were observed around the boat launch. A sample was analyzed for Microcystins, using the Abraxis strip test kit, resulting in a non-detect. 

5/19/2020: The sample from 5/13/2020 that was sent to Bend Genetics resulted in non-detects for Anatoxin-a, Cylindrospermopsin, Microcystin/Nod and Saxitoxin. On 5/19/20, cyanobacteria were not observed at the boat launch. Caution advisory remains

On 5/13/20, small sparse colonies of Dolichospermum-type cyanobacteria were observed around the boat launch. A sample was sent to Bend Genetics for analysis. We will have results early next week.

On 5/1/20, the cyanobacteria conditions appear improved, but wind and waves could be the cause. The wind and waves made it difficult to collect any other tiny particles that could be a few small Aphanizomenon-type strands. Only a few small clumps of Dolichospermum-type cyanobacteria were observed around the boat launch and along to shore towards the intake pipes.

4/21/20: the conditions looked better.

Since there are algal mats are present, we recommend practicing Healthy Water Habits when visiting the lake and ensuring children and dogs do not swallow any algal material. 

5/7/2020: Two samples were collected on 5/1/2020, the mat sample with no visible cyanobacteria contained no toxin producing genes. The sample with visible cyanobacteria contained toxin producing genes. Cyanotoxin results are still pending. Note: during the field investigation cyanobacteria were observed at a single 30 meter stretch of shoreline. The rest of the 500 meter shoreline survey found no visible cyanobacteria.

5/5/2020: On 5/1/2020, Water Board and Regional Board staff visited Lake Berryessa. Benthic algal mats were identified, but they were dominated by non-toxic algae. Though some cyanobacteria was observed in a 30 meter stretch of shoreline. Two samples were collected, one without visible cyanobacteria and one with cyanobacterialSamples were submitted for toxin analysis and we are awaiting results. The Caution advisory remains until toxin results are received. Avoid ingesting or swallowing any mat material.

Analysis to quantify total toxin producing cyanobacteria by toxin class using qPCR methods did not indicate the presence of any toxin producing gene copies.
